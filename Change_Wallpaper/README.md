# Change Wallpaper on Windows (Tested on Windows 10)
Pretty self explanatory, just change the url to the one you want

# How it works
Uses powershell to wget an image with a custom name and places it on the Desktop

Sets it as Desktop background

Deletes image into oblivion

# Note
You may need to change the delay because internet speeds may be slow: https://github.com/PlatyPooper/Digispark-Duckduino/blob/master/Change_Wallpaper/Change_Wallpaper.ino#L12
